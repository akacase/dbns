This hallway is composed of little more than a field of energy.  The
floor, the walls, even the ceiling are nothing but particles of solid
light, tightly packed and radiating a pale blue hue.  This curious field
suspends the transport deck at the direct center, in addition to holding in
the artificial atmosphere of the satellite.

ESF RS-1: Lower Deck Transporter~
A circular platform stands here in the center of the corridor, fueled by
a series of wires and terminals.  This platform transports visitors to the
lower terminal, enabling access back to the facility on Earth, as well as
the other sections of the RS-1.  To the north a series of healing tanks can
be seen lining the walls beyond a gravity terminal, and to the south you
can make out what appear to be a row of repair and maintenance shops. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&YTo teleport to another section, simply state the number of the desired
level, beginning with '0' for the first level below.

ESF RS-1: Gravity Terminal~
The artificial gravity of the RS-1 pulls with much greater force as you
approach the large machine at the center of the room.  The air is heavy and
hard to breathe, and the lights are dim compared to the surrounding halls,
creating the illusion of tunnel vision.

of depth skewed by the subtle field of energy present in the air.  Pipes
and sealed wiring line the highest corners and disappear into ducts and
terminals, many of which are used to generate the artificial gravity in
each stretch of the hall.  The occasional ESF officer or maintenance droid
meanders past, ensuring the terminals are in perfect working condition.

ESF RS-1: Command Deck~
You stand amidst the RS-1's command deck, a massive intersection of
corridors lined with the finest communications equipment in the galaxy. 
The ceilings on this deck of the station are nonexistent, replaced instead
with a constant field of barely visible, pale blue energy armed to trap the
artificial atmosphere safely in place, as well as to repel any space debris
that may collide with the station.  Control and communication terminals
line every inch of the deck, and jutting upward like a pillar in the direct
center sits the captain's private deck.

ESF RS-1: Command Deck~
You stand amidst the RS-1's command deck, a massive intersection of
corridors lined with the finest communications equipment in the galaxy. 
The ceilings on this deck of the station are nonexistent, replaced instead
with a constant field of barely visible, pale blue energy armed to trap the
artificial atmosphere safely in place, as well as to repel any space debris
that may collide with the station.  Control and communication terminals
line every inch of the deck, and jutting upward like a pillar in the direct

ESF RS-1: Command Deck~
You stand amidst the RS-1's command deck, a massive intersection of
corridors lined with the finest communications equipment in the galaxy. 
The ceilings on this deck of the station are nonexistent, replaced instead
with a constant field of barely visible, pale blue energy armed to trap the
artificial atmosphere safely in place, as well as to repel any space debris
that may collide with the station.  Control and communication terminals
line every inch of the deck, and jutting upward like a pillar in the direct
center sits the captain's private deck.

ESF RS-1: Command Deck~
You stand amidst the RS-1's command deck, a massive intersection of
corridors lined with the finest communications equipment in the galaxy. 
The ceilings on this deck of the station are nonexistent, replaced instead
with a constant field of barely visible, pale blue energy armed to trap the
artificial atmosphere safely in place, as well as to repel any space debris
that may collide with the station.  Control and communication terminals
line every inch of the deck, and jutting upward like a pillar in the direct
center sits the captain's private deck.

ESF RS-1: Command Deck~
You stand amidst the RS-1's command deck, a massive intersection of
corridors lined with the finest communications equipment in the galaxy. 
The ceilings on this deck of the station are nonexistent, replaced instead
with a constant field of barely visible, pale blue energy armed to trap the
artificial atmosphere safely in place, as well as to repel any space debris
that may collide with the station.  Control and communication terminals
line every inch of the deck, and jutting upward like a pillar in the direct
center sits the captain's private deck.
