Before The Facility~
An enormous, starkly white building stands before you, towering above
even the greatest skyscrapers in the distance.  Replete with a set of
massive doors large enough to accomodate a tank, it's no small wonder that
this is indeed a military training facility-- the primary base of the
Earth's Special Forces.

sections, instead there are only battered door frames and remnants of
shattered metal littering the floor tiles.

strong. A loose wire or two hangs down from the mottled ceiling tiles, and
from all around you the sounds of battle are apparent.  Trainees occupying
the halls can be seen darting in and out of individual rooms.  Perhaps you
should join them for a little training?

First Floor: Advanced Junction~
The lights in this junction flicker wildly and appear to be in various
stages of burning out, if they haven't already been completely destroyed
long ago.  The halls rumble ominously, and looser floor tiles wobble and
shake, threatening to break apart under the stress of some unseen force. 
Whatever is causing this disturbance is much stronger than anything you've
previously encountered in the building.

A bright halogen light here shuts off entirely as you make your way

throughout the hall.  This section appears to be in much greater need of
repair than the previous, its earthly construction barely able to contain
the intense training of its advanced ranks.

A Large Energy Barrier~
A furious, crackling shield of energy erupts from a curious contraption
embedded here in the floor, radiating a pale blue light until disappearing
into another, similar machine hanging down from the ceiling. This machine
appears to block off any stray energy that might escape the confines of the
room beyond, but it allows for physical matter to pass through
effortlessly.

This entire room is coated in a pale blue light, projected from the
large barriers extending across the walls and ceiling.  Although the floor
is unprotected, a strange metallic sheen seems to give it unearthly
strength, so protecting the building from the fighting strength of the

A Completely Destroyed Arena~
The whole of this arena is damaged beyond recognition.  Where once the
floor tiles would have supported a fighter's weight, now nothing but debris
and rubble remains.  A gaping hole toward the back of the "room" opens this
section of the building to the outside, and it appears that you might be
able to &Rslip&W through the twisted metal and concrete.&D

You stand on a repair scaffold secured to the side of the building, the

below.  The winds here are oppressive, but large flaps of cloth lay
stretched across in all directions, protecting the maintenance staff from
the biting cold as they work to repair any "accidental" damage to the
building.  An enormous hole in the side of the building creates an opening
here, and it looks like you may be able to &Rslip&W through.&D

A Snaking Air Duct~
This air duct is full of loose bits and pieces of junk that have fallen
down from the maintenance bay, feeding into the scores of rogue droids who
have taken up residence here.  The stuffy, winding path occasionally takes
a dip downward, but it seems sturdy enough to support quite a bit of excess
weight.

The stairs finally come to an end beneath a brightly lit sign,
signifying your arrival on the eighth floor of the building.  The hall here
is eerily silent, save for the low hum of what appears to be a turbolift
further to the north.

Upper Turbolift~
Only the low hum of the surrounding cylinder penetrates the stoic
silence of the turbolift.  Unlike in the lower sections of the building,
this lift appears to see very little use, as if the general public were
loathe to travel this far into the facility.  A small computer terminal
sits in a depression to the side of the lift's sliding doors.

supported from beneath by twin pillars secured firmly to the lower floors.

coming to an almost perfect point in the skies above.  It appears you could
leap off this platform, but would you really want to?

The people in the streets below are nothing but dwindling specs at this
great height, and nothing but the sound of the battering wind fills your
ears. From here you can easily scale the side of the building upward, or
descend back toward the earth.

Gravity Acceleration Chamber Entryway~
This entire room reverberates with an intense, glowing light that seems
not of this world.  In the center sits a large computer terminal, flashing
and beeping as it awaits warriors to input a command. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&YThis room is designed exclusively with the Gravity Acceleration Device
in mind. Safeguards are in place to ensure you cannot remove one from this
room, but in the event you do manage to escape with one, do not, under any
circumstance, use it outside under threat of severe punishment.  Report any
bugs to an Administrator.&D

&WTo leave this room, speak '&Rexit&W' aloud.&D

Accelerated Healing Station~
A terminal sits here between what looks like two ATMs, with two enormous
robotic arms dangling off either side.  The prompt mentions something about
'emergency healing' for a 'reasonable fee', but it would take an
adventurous person to take it up on the offer.

Bernie's Secret Bunker~
The room behind the bar opens into a massive space full of all manner of
weapons and armour, dotting the walls and dangling from the ceiling.  A
baby grand piano sits in the center, but upon closer inspection, it's
actually full of nothing but guns and ammunition.

A Rift in Time~
The familiar fades into chaos around you.  The 'earth' at your feet
feels solid, but upon closer inspection is nothing more than roiling mist,
shifting in and out of existence according to its own whims.  The sky has
no horizon, only an endless mirrored reflection of your own body.

Unlike the rest of the void, the air here is calm and easy to breathe,
as if weathering against the extreme conditions outside.  There appears to
be a healing tank to the west, and a row of gravity chambers to the east. 
You can sense a distinct array of distant powers to the north, but the
light obscures your vision.  A curious opening in the floorboards leads
downwards.

Thousands of tiny blinking buttons light up the room, and a fluffy black
pilot's chair sits in the center of it all. A ladder behind it leads back
down into the main hall, or continues up to the co-pilot's nest.

instrument panels for the pilot and co-pilot, each outfitted with a control
panel along the left arm and a piloting joystick for manual control, when
necessary, on the right.  A ladder leading up into the Gunnery Station can

As you ascend into the Gunnery Station you realize it is not so much a
room but a compact bubble atop the ship providing an unobstructed view
around and above the ship. Two chairs sit opposite one another suspended
from a swivel mechanism mounted to the floor.  Both chairs have a large
holographic display visible in front of them that can be utilized to
operate the radar tracking and weapons targeting systems.

table is a holographic display that can be used for planning, research, or
as is usually the case, cartoons.  A kitchen area can be seen to the west
while a sign next to a hallway leading north reads 'Cockpit and Gunnery
Station.'

of you a long preparation island runs the length of the middle of the room,
providing more than enough space to cook the large meals necessary to feed
the ship's crew.

The Looming Gates~
The gates of a seemingly infinite temple stretch upward into the
unknown, casting looming shadows over an uncertain void.  Faint lights
flicker around you, disappearing into the walls like ghostly apparitions. 
The gates seem impenetrable, but as you approach they swing effortlessly
open, welcoming you inside.  Nothing awaits but darkness.

Bright Parlor~
A bright light erupts through the darkness.  Before you understand what
has happened, you find yourself in a very different place.  Monks hurriedly
scatter in all directions, disappearing behind the great pillars lining the
center of an ethereal parlor.

A Flowery Hallway~
Attached to the great rooms on either side is this hallway, stretching
for what seems like forever between a canopy of flowery plantlife.  Unseen
birds chirp a calming melody, and the subtle flittering of insect wings
echoes above you.

Temple Forum~
A great many seats descend into a circle of dirt at the center of this
massive room.  Looking up reveals there to be no ceiling, only a bright
light that appears to grow faint, but never disappears no matter how far
into the distance it travels.  Monks gather here and there, discussing the
events of the day in some tongue you don't quite recognize.  A long hallway
lies to the south, and to the east you can vaguely make out the sounds of
fighting.

Resting Chambers~
Despite the sounds of combat getting louder to the east, this room
permeates with an aura of relaxation.  Merely standing here you feel rested
and rejuvenated.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to take a break here when
required.
