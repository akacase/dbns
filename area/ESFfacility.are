A once beautiful, starkly white building lays in ruins.  Piles of rubble
lay all around, with banners and chunks of concrete strewn in all
directions.  Whatever happened here, it must have been something incredibly
powerful. 

On closer inspection, you see a tiny note dangling out of the rubble.

strong. A loose wire or two hangs down from the mottled ceiling tiles, and
from all around you the sounds of battle are apparent.  Trainees occupying

should join them for a little training?

First Floor: Advanced Junction~
The lights in this junction flicker wildly and appear to be in various
stages of burning out, if they haven't already been completely destroyed
long ago.  The halls rumble ominously, and looser floor tiles wobble and
shake, threatening to break apart under the stress of some unseen force. 
Whatever is causing this disturbance is much stronger than anything you've
previously encountered in the building.

A Large Energy Barrier~
A furious, crackling shield of energy erupts from a curious contraption
embedded here in the floor, radiating a pale blue light until disappearing
into another, similar machine hanging down from the ceiling. This machine
appears to block off any stray energy that might escape the confines of the
room beyond, but it allows for physical matter to pass through
effortlessly.

A Completely Destroyed Arena~
The whole of this arena is damaged beyond recognition.  Where once the
floor tiles would have supported a fighter's weight, now nothing but debris
and rubble remains.  A gaping hole toward the back of the "room" opens this
section of the building to the outside, and it appears that you might be
able to &Rslip&W through the twisted metal and concrete.&D

You stand on a repair scaffold secured to the side of the building, the

below.  The winds here are oppressive, but large flaps of cloth lay
stretched across in all directions, protecting the maintenance staff from
the biting cold as they work to repair any "accidental" damage to the
building.  An enormous hole in the side of the building creates an opening
here, and it looks like you may be able to &Rslip&W through.&D

Supply Duct Entrance~
Nearly buried behind a stack of loose parts sits a large air duct big
enough to accomodate a small truck.  The grate that once covered it has long
since been salvaged by some crazy droid, leaving it wide open for random
assortments of junk to topple down into the abyss.

Descending into an Air Duct~
A ladder attached to the side of the duct allows it to be easily
traversed, although nothing can be seen in the darkness below.  The sounds
of scraping metal can be heard, echoing through the sheet metal composing
the walls.

This air duct is full of loose bits and pieces of junk that have fallen
down from the maintenance bay, feeding into the scores of rogue droids who
have taken up residence here.  The stuffy, winding path occasionally takes
a dip downward, but it seems sturdy enough to support quite a bit of excess

Third Floor: Busy Intersection~
The hallway opens here into a busy intersection.  All around you the
members of the ESF are single-mindedly going about their business, many
carrying supplies or training equipment from one of the few shopping
facilities dotting this section.  A large, neon yellow sign sits at the
center of the intersection, demanding the attention of any curious
passers-by.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&YVisitors looking to rest may do so in the lounge to the south.  Training
facilities are located to the east and west, as well as the armory and the
medical supplier.

Third Floor: Before the Armory~
This busy and cluttered hallway runs the span between both of the
training facilities on this floor of the building.  Potted plants and other
atmospheric decorations line the walls beneath the usual signs, and a long,
winding blue arrow is painted across the length of the white floor tiles. 
Lights line the panels as well, occasionally blinking in and out of
existence. The arrow veers off from its straight and narrow course here,
sitors into the shop to the north.

Fourth Floor: Gravity Chamber~
The air here weighs down on your shoulders like a ton of bricks, making
even the simplest tasks consume great effort. The intense pressure
contained here is a product of the machine located in the center of the
room, constantly outputting a massive field of gravimetric energy.

A series of large, bubbling tanks line the walls here, each large enough
to contain a person. The special fluid bubbling through each escapes into
the air in a thick vapor, healing even the most grievous of wounds in an
amazingly short span of time.

Fourth Floor: Android Upgrade Chamber~
This elaborately lit chamber houses a massive machine capable of
performing mechanical upgrades to any android seeking them.  Strewn about
the room are many loose parts and odds and ends, each never sitting in one
place for long before being put to use by a passing repair droid.

Fifth Floor: Beneath a Winding Stairway~
Your eyes are immediately drawn to an enormous stairway as you step
forth from the turbolift, winding its way upward and away into the relative
darkness of the upper floors of the facility.

These winding stairs seem to go on forever, coiling about the shaft of
an unused turbolift.  If these floors of the facility are used for
anything, it's clear from the suspiciously plain walls that they have long
since been closed off to the general public.  Where otherwise a door may
have existed, instead there remains only thick, sealed metal plating.

The stairs finally come to an end beneath a brightly lit sign,
signifying your arrival on the eighth floor of the building.  The hall here
is eerily silent, save for the low hum of what appears to be a turbolift
further to the north.

Upper Turbolift~
Only the low hum of the surrounding cylinder penetrates the stoic
silence of the turbolift.  Unlike in the lower sections of the building,
this lift appears to see very little use, as if the general public were
loathe to travel this far into the facility.  A small computer terminal
sits in a depression to the side of the lift's sliding doors.

Twentieth Floor: Transport Deck~
The protection afforded the other floors of the ESF facility are no
where to found in this section.  Where otherwise the walls may have been
specially coated with strengthening materials, instead the entire area is
open to the skies with enormous transparent windows.

Twentieth Floor: External Platform~
The walls of the facility end abruptly here, opening into the vast, blue
sky.  Piercing winds ricochet across the flat plane laid out here,
supported from beneath by twin pillars secured firmly to the lower floors. 
This section appears much thinner than the lower echelons of the building,
coming to an almost perfect point in the skies above.  It appears you could
leap off this platform, but would you really want to?

Twentieth Floor: Transport Terminal~
Every light in this corridor converges into a huge transport terminal,
attached to the rear wall by way of a series of thick, snaking tubes and
wires. A circular platform sits in the direct center, awaiting the command
to send its activator into parts unknown.

Soaring Beside the ESF Facility~
You find yourself soaring just beside the ESF transport deck, at least
twenty floors above the earth.  High winds snap across the side of the
building, catching banners and sending the cloth billowing in all
directions.  From here it appears you can &Rdescend&W back into the
facility, or continue further upward along the building.

Accelerated Healing Station~
A terminal sits here between what looks like two ATMs, with two enormous

Bernie's Secret Bunker~
The room behind the bar opens into a massive space full of all manner of
weapons and armour, dotting the walls and dangling from the ceiling.  A
baby grand piano sits in the center, but upon closer inspection, it's
actually full of nothing but guns and ammunition.

as well, as if it doesn't quite belong anywhere in the flow of time.

A Rift in Time~
The familiar fades into chaos around you.  The 'earth' at your feet
feels solid, but upon closer inspection is nothing more than roiling mist,
shifting in and out of existence according to its own whims.  The sky has
no horizon, only an endless mirrored reflection of your own body.

First Vision: Ribbon of Remembrance~
The ground is truly solid here, paved with concrete and lined with
countless evergreen trees.  Despite appearing real, you have the sense
things aren't quite as they appear: this is only a vision of a past once
experienced by another, twisted from another universe.

A Giant Armored Gate~
A wall made of concrete, brick and steel stretches far overhead, barring
the way with a massive iron door.  Inside lies the headquarters for the Red
Ribbon Army, and already you can hear men shouting orders, and winding
gears of machinery.

Red Ribbon Army HQ: Entranceway~
The iron doors swing open as if expecting you, allowing you in or out as
you please.  In the distance you can make out what appears to be a
grandiose mansion, with smaller buildings and supply depots dotting the
soldier-filled streets.  Back south lies the rift.

rustic lamps adorn the doorway, welcoming you inside.

Mansion Foyer~
A glittering crystal chandelier dangles high overhead, scattering prisms
of light across the ornate carpeting.  Posh hallways lead to the east and
western annexes, and a stairway with gem-encrusted banisters leads upward. 
Behind the stairway you can make out a lavish parlor to the north.

Mansion Hall~
Much like the one in the foyer, chandeliers dot the ceiling every few
steps down this hallway, its designer clearly sparing no expense.  Statues
of an unusually short man with an eye patch line the walls.

Ammunitions Depot: Southeast Corner~
The polished walls of the depot curve gently here, doing little to
obscure the massive gun sitting in the center of the floor plating.

This building is absolutely cavernous, requiring you to crane your head

see, propped against metal collumns.  A small partitioned room sits to the
east, where a massive pile of ammunition glitters in the flourescent
lighting.

A Pile of Dangerous Weaponry~
From the ceiling to the floor, nearly every inch of this partitioned off
room is covered in grenades, missiles, assault weapons, and more than a few
objects you don't quite recognize.

Wartorn Runway~
What was once a runway for aircraft is lined with rubble and broken
machinery, barely allowing a human to squeeze through the makeshift
concrete path.  Gunfire resounds all around you, as if some eternal battle
were raging just out of sight.

Hyperbolic Time Fracture~
The world behind the transparent glass seems to zip ahead at extreme
speeds.  In mere minutes, Doctor Emalia completes an entire day's work in a
blur of indistinguishable motion.  The only apparent exits are north into a
building amidst the void, or back through the transparent doors to resume
life at normal speed.

Hyperbolic Time Fracture: First Stratum Facility~
Unlike the rest of the void, the air here is calm and easy to breathe,
as if weathering against the extreme conditions outside.  There appears to
be a healing tank to the west, and a row of gravity chambers to the east. 
You can sense a distinct array of distant powers to the north, but the
light obscures your vision.  A curious opening in the floorboards leads
downwards.

taunting you with each passing moment.

Thousands of tiny blinking buttons light up the room, and a fluffy black
pilot's chair sits in the center of it all. A ladder behind it leads back
down into the main hall, or continues up to the co-pilot's nest.

Flight Deck - Cockpit~
Various guidance instruments and display panels for piloting the ship
sit above and a large viewing window that spans the width of the cockpit
before you.  Two large and seemingly comfortable chairs sit in front of the
instrument panels for the pilot and co-pilot, each outfitted with a control
panel along the left arm and a piloting joystick for manual control, when
necessary, on the right.  A ladder leading up into the Gunnery Station can
be seen tucked in the corner to your right.

Gunnery Station~
As you ascend into the Gunnery Station you realize it is not so much a
room but a compact bubble atop the ship providing an unobstructed view
around and above the ship. Two chairs sit opposite one another suspended
from a swivel mechanism mounted to the floor.  Both chairs have a large
holographic display visible in front of them that can be utilized to
operate the radar tracking and weapons targeting systems.

Flight Deck - Commons~
A large table surrounded by chairs in the center of the room takes up
much of the space in the commons area.  Visible over the center of the
table is a holographic display that can be used for planning, research, or
as is usually the case, cartoons.  A kitchen area can be seen to the west
while a sign next to a hallway leading north reads 'Cockpit and Gunnery
Station.'

A rather lavish kitchen setup greets you as you enter the room.  To your
left are two refrigerators flanked by an assortment of cabinets while a
double-sink and 8-burner oven are situated to your right. Directly in front
of you a long preparation island runs the length of the middle of the room,
providing more than enough space to cook the large meals necessary to feed
the ship's crew.

panel on the wall to your left and two ladders in front of you leading to
separate levels of the ship. A sign near the ladder leading upwards reads
'Flight Deck' while a similar sign near the lower ladder reads 'Training
Deck.'

The Looming Gates~
The gates of a seemingly infinite temple stretch upward into the
unknown, casting looming shadows over an uncertain void.  Faint lights
flicker around you, disappearing into the walls like ghostly apparitions. 
The gates seem impenetrable, but as you approach they swing effortlessly
open, welcoming you inside.  Nothing awaits but darkness.

Bright Parlor~
A bright light erupts through the darkness.  Before you understand what
has happened, you find yourself in a very different place.  Monks hurriedly
scatter in all directions, disappearing behind the great pillars lining the
center of an ethereal parlor.

A Flowery Hallway~
Attached to the great rooms on either side is this hallway, stretching
for what seems like forever between a canopy of flowery plantlife.  Unseen
birds chirp a calming melody, and the subtle flittering of insect wings
echoes above you.

Temple Forum~
A great many seats descend into a circle of dirt at the center of this
massive room.  Looking up reveals there to be no ceiling, only a bright
light that appears to grow faint, but never disappears no matter how far
into the distance it travels.  Monks gather here and there, discussing the
events of the day in some tongue you don't quite recognize.  A long hallway
lies to the south, and to the east you can vaguely make out the sounds of
fighting.

Resting Chambers~
Despite the sounds of combat getting louder to the east, this room
permeates with an aura of relaxation.  Merely standing here you feel rested
and rejuvenated.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to take a break here when
required.
