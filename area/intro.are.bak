The Beginning~
You are entering the world of DragonBall: North Star.  Within lie many
adventures and battles that you must endure.  Hopefully your time here will
be entertaining!  We'll begin with a tutoral program for you so that you
may learn how to play this MUD.  Please continue north by typing "north".

Lesson 1 - Simple Commands~
Here you will be introduced to simple commands. First we shall teach you
how to move around in this world.  By typing in the direction you wish to go
that is where you shall be moved.  north, south, west, east, northwest,
northeast, southwest, and southeast.  All of these directions can be
abbreviated like this: n, s, w, e, nw, ne, sw, se.  That is all for this
lesson. Now type "up" to continue with the tutorial.

Lesson 2 - Communication~
Communication is the key to surviving in any world.  You can talk to
people in the same room as you by typing "say <what you want to say>". You
may also talk to a person not in the same room as you with the "tell"
command.  The public channels are channels that everyone who has them
activated will hear what you say.  You may use all of them how ever, the
"CHAT" channel is only for role playing messages.  If you are wanting to
talk to people, but you don't want to role play at the moment then please
use the "OOC" channel.  OOC stands for Out of Charecter.

&YNew players are restricted to the 'newbie' channel for a short while.&d

Lesson 3 - Combat~
You will have to fight many different battles in this world, so you must
learn how to fight back.  Use the "kill" command to get into a fight with
someone.  Your powerlevel determines how well you can fight in many ways,
but most importantly how strong you are compared to your opponent.  If you
would like to practice fighting go to the "east".  To the west are the
healing tanks where you can quickly gain back your strength, as well a
chamber to increase your stats.

Lesson 3a - Fighting~
Here you will practice actual combat.  The android here is programmed to
help you learn how to fight.  Just type "kill android" to begin battle.  If
this android becomes too easy, more await you in the training chambers
above.  If you require skill training, a master awaits you to the east.

Tutoral End~
That is all that you need to know to survive in the DragonBall Saga.
There is much, much more for you to learn, but you should now have a basic
understanding of this world.  If you are ready to leave this tutoral then
answer one question using say.

"What kind of Triggers are allowed?"

Upon answering the question, you will be transported to South City, or
Dr. Gero's lab, if you are an Android. Happy Mudding and G'luck.

This is where your Journey shall begin.

Lesson 4 - Rules of the Game~
Now that you're familiarized with the commands, you must agree to the
rules of the game to continue.  DBNS currently has no restrictions on
botting, multiplaying, or language, but the Administration does ask that
you remain respectful to players and staff at all times.  Harassment of any
kind will not be tolerated.  To continue to the game, please say "I agree".
