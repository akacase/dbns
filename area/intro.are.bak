The Beginning~
You are entering the world of DragonBall: North Star.  Within lie many
adventures and battles that you must endure.  Hopefully your time here will
be entertaining!  We'll begin with a tutorial program for you so that you
may learn how to play this MUD.  Please continue north by typing "north".

Lesson 1 - Simple Commands~
Here you will be introduced to simple commands. First we shall teach you
how to move around in this world.  By typing in the direction you wish to go
that is where you shall be moved.  north, south, west, east, northwest,
northeast, southwest, and southeast.  All of these directions can be
abbreviated like this: n, s, w, e, nw, ne, sw, se.  That is all for this
lesson. Now type "up" to continue with the tutorial.

Lesson 2 - Communication~
Communication is the key to surviving in any world.  You can talk to
people in the same room as you by typing "say <what you want to say>". You
may also talk to a person not in the same room as you with the "tell"
command.  The public channels are channels that everyone who has them
activated will hear what you say.  You may use all of them how ever, the
"CHAT" channel is only for role playing messages.  If you are wanting to
talk to people, but you don't want to role play at the moment then please
use the "OOC" channel.  OOC stands for Out of Charecter.

&YNew players are restricted to the 'newbie' channel for a short while.&d

Lesson 3 - Combat~
You will have to fight many different battles in this world, so you must
learn how to fight back.  Use the "kill" command to get into a fight with
someone.  Your powerlevel determines how well you can fight in many ways,
but most importantly how strong you are compared to your opponent.  If you
would like to practice fighting go to the "east".  To the west are the
healing tanks where you can quickly gain back your strength, as well a
chamber to increase your stats.

Tutoral End~
That is all that you need to know to survive in the DragonBall Saga.
There is much, much more for you to learn, but you should now have a basic
understanding of this world.  If you are ready to leave this tutoral then
answer one question using say.

"What kind of Triggers are allowed?"

Upon answering the question, you will be transported to South City, or
Dr. Gero's lab, if you are an Android. Happy Mudding and G'luck.

This is where your Journey shall begin.

Tutorial~
Welcome again to Dragon Ball: North Star!  Before you get started in the
world, there are a few special commands and mechanics that set DBNS apart
from other similar games in the genre.  In this tutorial section, you'll
learn all you need to eventually become the strongest in the Universe! 
Maybe.

&YIf this is an alt of yours and you'd like to skip this business, say
&Rskip&Y to proceed directly to the main game!&d

Time-Based Powerup~
To control your powerlevel, use the 'powerup' command.  'powerup begin'
will enter a stance where you begin channeling your energy, and 'powerup
stop' will halt it.  For the moment, you may not be powerful enough to see
much--or any--difference, but fighting in your maximum powerup state will
train your body's ability to control your energy.  'powerup train' will
enter a stance that increases your control bit by bit, at the cost of a
chunk of your current Ki.

To return to your base powerlevel, simply type 'powerdown'. Also see
'&Chelp suppress&g' for more advanced options to control your powerlevel.
&Y
It's recommended to balance between 'powerup train' and 'meditate' to
recover your Ki early on for a great boost in power!  &d

Exceeding your Safe Limit~
For those who like to live a little more dangerously, once you're done
powering up you can go &Yeven further beyond&g your limits!  'powerup push'
will enter a stance that exchanges Ki for a temporary increase in maximum
powerlevel.  But be warned, pushing too hard for too long may result in an
untimely end.

Remember to 'powerup stop' before it's too late!

Skills & Masteries~
Acquiring skills in DBNS is not based on meeting powerlevel
requirements, but instead is a function of your training during combat. 
Type 'skills' to see a list of your masteries, then 'skills <mastery>' for
a look at which abilities you possess relative to each.  You may also enter
'skills <skillname>' for an even deeper look into individual abilities.  

As you fight and use abilities under a given mastery that mastery will
increase, adding to the effectiveness of all combat skills associated with
it!

Developing New Skills~
Obtaining more powerful abilities requires training those you're already
familiar with.  To throw heavier punches, one must practice with 'punch'
for a time and '&Yresearch&g' using the skill knowledge obtained, for
example.

Typing 'research' on its own will present you with your currently unspent
&YSP&g.  As seen in 'skills <skillname>', combat skills possess a Power and
Efficiency level.  To add unspent SP, type 'research <skillname> power' or
'research <skillname> efficiency'.  

Most skills require &Y6 total levels invested&g before they can be further developed.

See '&Chelp skillcombos&g' for a list of moves you can develop!

acquire the Vigor skill, which will aid you in &Yexercising&g.&d

Exercise & Stat Gaining~
Your primary stats will increase naturally during combat based on your
actions, but you may also increase your stats outside of combat. 
'meditate' is one way to increase your Intelligence, but your other
statistics require &Yexercise&g.  First type 'rest' to enter a relaxed
position, then 'exercise pushup', 'exercise shadowbox', or 'exercise
endure' to train STR, SPD, or CON respectively.  Note that training CON may
only be performed with heavy weighted clothing, or under greater than
Earth's normal gravity.

Exercise will take its toll on your body, however, especially when doing
&Yintense&g exercise.  To work out more intensely than normal, enter
'exercise <type> intensely' and you'll see much better gains, at the cost
of even greater Ki drain.  Be careful, for if you run out of Ki this action
will begin draining health!  To stop at any point, type 'exercise stop'. 

The &YVigor&g skill will speed up the fatigue recovery from intense exercise.

Fighting Styles~
Before you enter combat proper, you'll want to choose a &Yfighting
style&g.  To do so, type 'style <style>', your standard options being:

Evasive: A style that prioritizes raw speed and defense, but lands weak
individual blows.

Defensive: A style that priotizes defense, but only slightly weakens
outgoing damage.

Standard: The default style, neither defensive nor offensively heavy.

Aggressive: A style that prioritizes offense at the cost of taking
increased damage.

Berserk: A style that recklessly emphasizes offense and takes the most
damage overall.

Substyles~
Now that you've chosen a style, you may select a &Ysubstyle&g. 
Substyles will affect your stat growth, as well as which of your offensive
stats determine your round melee damage.

To choose your substyle, type 'style <substyle>', your options being:

Hybrid: Balanced between INT and STR.

Bruiser: Emphasize STR.

Energy: Emphasize INT.

&YIf you happen to die, remember to re-enable your substyle!  &g

Combat & Powerlevel Gains~
Your strength in combat is based on your &Ypowerlevel&g compared to your
opponent's.  As you may have noticed, you begin with a powerlevel of &Y5&g,
about as strong as the average Earthling adult.  Until you've reached a
powerlevel of &Y50&g, your powerlevel will increase alongside your stats,
but may raise much more slowly for a time afterward.

Take care to increase your base stats as much as possible, for they're much
more important than your base powerlevel in DBNS!  In fact, it's impossible
to know just how strong someone is from their base powerlevel alone.

Roshi here to receive a parting gift as you're sent on your way.
