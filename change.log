DB: NORTH STAR - v1.0
----------
- Introduce Rust into the build process (still undecided about this)
- IMC is removed, starting another implementation of an IMP ((I)nter (M)ud (P)rotocol system).
    - GOALS:
    - share pfiles seamlessly and securely across networks, it'll allow seamless communication between two seperate muds (with the same codebase)
    - more to come.
- new make targets, see Makefile.
- seperated the process from the data directories to aid in privelege seperation.
- use of gmake has been replaced with bsdmake.
- arc4random(3) replaces rand(3) and the Knuth algorithms for generating entropy; we use the OS for that now.
- opendir(3) now checks for NULL, adding stability and safety, particularly in new setups.
- restructuring of code from old (crazy?) style guide to OpenBSD style(9) - in progress.
- added init folder with rc.d service, should work on all BSDs.
- bye windows, you suck.
- removing as much dead code as possible.
- custom file formats to something else? WIP
